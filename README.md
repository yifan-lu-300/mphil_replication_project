This repository is for the Replication Project paper, which is part of the MPhil Sociology & Demography programme at University of Oxford.

The project replicates the paper ["Does Retirement Trigger Ill Health?"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.1712), published in *Health Economics* by Behncke (2012).

The data used in the project is the first three waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). If you are a member from UK Higher Education Institutions, you can access the data from the [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5050).
